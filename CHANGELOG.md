# BATCHFONT2MESH (BF2M) CHANGELOG

A record of our journey into the text-based void.

*The names for each version were absolutely generated by Gemini and I'm not even sorry.*

---

## v1.3.0 - The Documentation Domination

- **DOCS GALORE:** Added a full suite of documentation files: a professional `README_REAL.md`, the cringe-tastic `INSTRUCTIONS.txt`, the ever-expanding `ROADMAP.txt`, and this very changelog.

---

## v1.2.1 - The Graceful Failure

- **CRITICAL FIX:** Patched a `RuntimeError` on addon installation when dependencies failed. The placeholder Operator classes were missing a required `bl_label`, causing the registration to crash. They are now valid, disabled operators that allow the addon to load and display an error correctly.

---

## v1.2.0 - The Pip Bootstrap

- **CRITICAL FIX:** Completely overhauled the dependency installer (`dependencies.py`).
- **PIP BOOTSTRAP:** The old script was a clown carâ€”it assumed `pip` was installed, which isn't a guarantee in Blender's Python. The new script is a certified GigaChad: It now properly bootstraps `pip` using `ensurepip` before trying to install `freetype-py`.
- **REAL LOGGING:** This provides WAY better logging to the System Console and fixes the silent "it just doesn't work" failures. The console is our friend now.

---

## v1.1.1 - The Packager's Paradox

- **BUILD SCRIPT:** Added a `package_addon.py` script to automate zipping the addon for distribution.
- **FIXES ON FIXES:** Went through approximately 500 revisions of the packaging script to get the pathing just right. It is now a monument to our stubbornness.

---

## v1.1.0 - The Decoupling

- **ARCHITECTURE:** Ripped the UI Panel class out of `__init__.py` and moved it into its own `ui.py` file. The project is now cleaner than my search history.
- **ORGANIZATION:** The addon is now a proper multi-file package. It's all grown up. ðŸ¥²

---

## v1.0.0 - THE MAIN EVENT

- **GENERATION LOGIC:** The "Generate Meshes" button is now fully armed and operational!
- **FULL BATCHING:** It actually loops through every character in the font file now.
- **POST-PROCESSING:** All the bevel mode toggles (Mark Sharp, V-Groups, Multi-Material, V-Colors) are fully implemented.
- **MESH CLEANUP:** "Remove Doubles" option now works.
- **UI FEEDBACK:** Added a real progress bar to the Blender status area during generation. No more guessing if it's crashed or not.

---

## v0.3.0 - The Dependency Dance

- **BIG CHANGE:** Addon converted into a multi-file package (`__init__.py`, `dependencies.py`). This was the first attempt, which led to the bootstrap revelation.
- **DEPENDENCY MANAGER:** Added the first version of a dependency script to try and install `freetype-py` into a local folder.
- **ROBUSTNESS:** Laid the groundwork for the addon to check for dependencies and show an error instead of just crashing.

---

## v0.2.1 - The Path Correction

- **FIX:** My fallback plan was cringe. Implemented the `sys.path` correction logic to proactively find Blender's bundled `freetype` library. A noble, but ultimately flawed, effort.

---

## v0.2.0 - The Workflow Revolution

- **NEW WORKFLOW:** Ripped out the old single-button idea and implemented the "Prepare > Tweak > Generate" workflow.
- **LIVE PREVIEW:** Added the live "Preview" text object that updates in real-time as you change UI settings. This was a game-changer.
- **DYNAMIC UI:** The panel is now dynamic, showing more options after you "Prepare" a font.
- **BEVEL MODES:** Replaced the old dropdown with mix-and-match toggle buttons for post-processing options.

---

## v0.1.0 - The Genesis Block

- **INITIAL COMMIT:** The first script was born, I got confused about the API but we survived.
- **BOILERPLATE:** Basic addon structure (`bl_info`, properties, a panel, a placeholder operator).
- **UI SKELETON:** Laid out all the UI elements we wanted.
